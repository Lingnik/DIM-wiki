**DIM** is a community-developed item manager for [Destiny](http://www.destinythegame.com). DIM can move items between characters and the vault without visiting in-game vaults. DIM's emphasis on maximizing the player's time in Destiny, efficiency of its modern user experience, and features that give players unique capabilities combine to give players a greater degree lethality and more opportunity to earn new items than vanilla players.
