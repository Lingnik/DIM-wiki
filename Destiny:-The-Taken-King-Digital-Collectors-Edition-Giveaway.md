We'll be giving away a copy of Destiny: The Taken King Digital Collectors Edition today on Datto's Twitch Stream of the TTK Launch. To enter the giveaway, all you have to do is 

1. Follow [@ThisIsDIM](http://twitter.com/ThisIsDIM), and 
2, Tweet of a screen shot of DIM with your characters using the hashtag #DIMYearTwo.  

We really want to get this copy of TTK into the hands of a Guardian today.  Your window of opportunity to post a screenshot and follow @ThisIsDIM will be from 2AM to 11AM Pacific.  This will be a quick one Guardians as the give away will only last 9 hours.  

We will then draw a winner form the the pool of users who have successful entries at 11AM Pacific, and announce the winner on Datto's stream and on our twitter, @ThisIsDIM.

Thanks for joining us at the start of Year Two and we'll see you in game.
The team at DIM.
