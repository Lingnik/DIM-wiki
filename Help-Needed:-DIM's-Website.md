We're looking for volunteers to help build a simple website to host at http://destinyitemmanager.com.  We've got all hands working on improving v3 and developing v4 at the moment, and we need your help to build a website for DIM that helps us share our message.

Our goals for the website are:

* Inform users of the features that are available in DIM and how they can improve a Guardian's experience while playing Destiny
* Document locations to download DIM
* Provide Support Links to the subreddit, twitter, or github issue tracker.
* Discuss the benefits of open source development and how people can improve DIM.

DIM's approach is 'straight-forward and powerful'.  We would like to see that aesthetic present in our website.

We would prefer that a single page website that is succinct and attractive. For example, this [demo] is a layout that presents information in chunks separated by section on a single page. We're not asking for animated website with transitions and parallax images. That's a distraction. We want to provide users with the necessary information and let them move on to using DIM or getting help if they need it.

Please contact us on [Twitter] or sign up for our [Slack] reach out to [Goose].
