Let's close Destiny's Year Two with a celebration of all that we've earned! 

We all know that the Cryptarch's can be bittersweet, bless their heart...  So the team at DIM has six DIM t-shirts and one Blacksmith Shader to give away to a few lucky Guardians. We're very excited to pick the winners, but we wanted to let you know that this giveaway also helps your fellow Guardians by spreading the word about DIM across twitter.  There are many who still prepare their characters by walking up to a Vault.  DIM can help them play more Destiny and we need you to let them know about us.

There are two ways to enter, each with its own unique entry, so let's talk details.

## Step One: Retweet the contest.
Follow [@ThisIsDIM](http://twitter.com/ThisIsDIM) on Twitter and retweet our [giveaway tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=639234613068603392).

## Step Two: Show off your #YearTwoGear with DIM
This is our favorite because we get to see so many Guardians. Follow [@ThisIsDIM](http://twitter.com/ThisIsDIM) on Twitter and tweet a screenshot of your characters in DIM with the status, "**This is my #Destiny #YearTwoGear with @ThisIsDIM - Giveaway Info http://bit.ly/2cuO7jI**".
