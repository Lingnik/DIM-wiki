Let's close Destiny's Year Two with a celebration of all that we've earned! 

We all know that the Cryptarch's can be bittersweet, bless their heart...  So the team at DIM has six DIM t-shirts and one Blacksmith Shader to give away to a few lucky Guardians. 

As excited as we are to pick the winners, we wanted to let you know that this giveaway also helps your fellow Guardians by spreading the word about DIM across solar system.  There are many who still prepare their characters every day by walking up to a Vault.  DIM can help them play more Destiny, but only if you help us get the word out.

There are two ways to enter, each with its own unique entry, so let's talk details.

## Step One: Retweet the contest.

## Step Two: Show off your #YearTwoGear with DIM
This is our favorite because we get to see so many Guardians.
