Since September 2015, players have plundered the Dreadnaught of its secrets, sent the husk of Oryx towards Saturn, and worked together to unlock the path to Tier 12.  During this time, Destiny Item Manager has always been here to help you enjoy more of your time playing Destiny. With DIM, you can find the right combination of gear to unlock T12 with the best perks, clean out your vault with our filtering and search, and automatically move engrams to the vault while playing strikes. We have much more planned for Year Three, but now is the time to close out Destiny's Year Two with a celebration of all that we've achieved.

## The Giveaway

We can all agree that the Cryptarchs can be bittersweet, bless their hearts... So the team at DIM wants to do our part and giveaway six DIM t-shirts and our VERY last Blacksmith Shader to a few lucky Guardians.

Your tweets this week will light a path to help your fellow Guardians by spreading the word about DIM across the solar system. There are many who prepare their characters every day by walking up to a Vault. DIM can help them spent more of their time playing Destiny, but only if you help us get the word out.
