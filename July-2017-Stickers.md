We've heard from many of you that would like to have one of our stickers, and we want to make that happen. Here's how we can do it. 

Everyone who contributes at least $5 to DIM using Open Collective between July 1st and August 1st will be be eligible to receive a sticker.  This will cover the cost of materials & shipping, and provide a small donation to DIM.

This is open to all locations world wide as long as USPS will accept a letter to your address with a stamp that cost no more than $1.15.  You can look it up here, [https://postcalc.usps.com/?country=10440](https://postcalc.usps.com/?country=10440).  Fingers crossed.  There will be no tracking numbers here.  

The Process.

1. **If you are not in the United States**, make sure the USPS can send a letter to your location for at most $1.15 at https://postcalc.usps.com/?country=10440.
1. **Become a backer of DIM** with a minimum $5 contribution at [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/dim).  
    1. A one-time contribution is fine, but [Monthly support will enable new ways so use DIM.](https://twitter.com/ThisIsDIM/status/876132618072358913).
    2. Contribution must be made between July 1st, 2017 and August 1st, 2017.
2. **Make sure you give a good email address** so we can reach out and get your shipping address in August.
4. **Sit tight.**  Letters with our sticker will go out a few weeks after I close out the month, order stickers, and get your addresses together.

Thank you all again for having interest in our efforts.  There are over 20 active contributors to DIM who want to make sure you can make the most of your game time.  DIM is our hobby and we're glad you enjoy it.
