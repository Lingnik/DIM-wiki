# Problem Statement

Players of Destiny need a convenient means to move their items.  The current means within Destiny and its Companion App are not optimal and require too much player time and attention to successful move an item from character to character.  The in game experience to transfer items between characters is at least five minutes, and could much longer depending on the available space in the vault and the items carried by the character.  A new interface and means to view all the players items and transferring items needs to be developed.  Such an offering could be a vehicle for delivering 3rd party enhancements to Destiny with additional features not available in game such as Loadouts.

# Overview

## Background

Players have one user-managed option to store items in game, the Vault. The vault is located in social spaces and can contain 108 weapons, 108 armor items, and 72 general items.  The player has to put items into the vault to make them available to other characters to remove.  This makes the vault the primary medium to move items between players. 

Maximum capacity per item type is usually 10 items, with one of them equipped.  General item types can vary in the amount of items they can store, ~20 items. Moving these items individually is a time consuming process which is aggravated if the player only has limited space in their vault.  The player would have to have enough room to move their items, or they would have to take one item out of the vault to put one from their character back into the vault.  This process is ripe for human error.
